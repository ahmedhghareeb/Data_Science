## Long trend dynamics in social media

**Objective/Abstract: What is the paper about, and what was the goal of the paper?**

This paper is about trend formation in social media. This is an important topic because user attention helps us understand problems in our culture, how opinions are formed and how decisions are made. Based on other research, most things that are posted to social media are ignored, but things some become really prominent and are able to shape social agenda since they become trends. The goal of this paper to to determine a model that looks at how social media trends.

**Hypothesis: Where any hypothoses made within the paper before the work began? If so, what was it? What did you think about it?**

The hypothesis is that by looking at patterns of user's continued interaction with a certain topics, it is possible to determine both the thresholds in popularity that lead to emergence in social media and also the duration of the trend.

**Methods: What methodologies did the paper use to approach its objective? How well did they work?**

In its model, the paper made a distinction between first time posts (FTP) and repeated posts (RP) to separate out how quickly the audience who was posting about the topic was growing vs how deeply the topic resonated with people who had already posted about the topic.

The paper looked at Twitter data (dataset of 16.32 million posts on 3361 topics) to determine topics and trends. It used the cumulative count of tweets and retweets for a topic as a proxy for the popularity of the topic.

It looked at the data for topics that were "trending" as determined by Twitter's algorithms.

**Conclusions: Overall assessment of the paper. This is generally broken into parts of what you thought about the material you read, do you think it was well written or poorly written, how well did it answer the questions it was looking at, and did you have any follow up questions about the data, methodologies, etc.**

I didn't follow all of the math in the paper, but the idea of separating out the FTP and RP make sense to me in terms of measuring virality and resonance respectively.
