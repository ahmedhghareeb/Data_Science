Strategies

considered different classifiers, but stuck with naive bayes since keeps the feature set and can look at most informative features. SVM actually did worse.

Unigrams alone
Bigrams alone
Trigrams alone
Capitalization percentage alone
Tweet Length
Removing stopwords (didn't help. Actually decreased accuracy. Words like "are", "an", "you", "your" are actually pretty helpful)

Unigrams + Bigrams --> Worse
not sure why, but it could potentially help with confidence if I had gotten AUC going...

Unigrams + best bigrams?

Next... Character ngrams
better filtering of words
Look at AUC
